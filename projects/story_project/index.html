        <h6>This is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy, uncool, and sad excuse of a high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. To say his life is "miserable" is an understatement. But one day while on a school field trip to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end. So who will it be?</h6>

            <h2>Peter Parker had no idea but his life was about to change forever!</h2>
            <p>At first he played it off as a regular spider bite. It hurt really bad, but it was nothing he couldn't handle. Either way, the swelling went down in a few hours and everything seemed to go back to normal. Peter went home, ate dinner with his aunt and uncle, and went to bed like any other day.</p>
